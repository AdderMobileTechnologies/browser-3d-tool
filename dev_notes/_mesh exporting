There are two ways that work for me right now. 
1) export as babylon.js file 
2) export as .obj 

The pros and cons:
exporting as babylon.js we can see the parameters we need clearly.
exporting as .obj we can not see the parameters we need , in fact they might not be there upon first glance at the file.

So, since a straight export as babylon.js included cameras, and lights, that I did not need. I'll try to delete those and then export as babylon.js (*bjs)



Process: 
1) Picked out an item, for instance the 'house' llike building on the corner.
2) exported it as an .obj file.
3) imported it into a blank new blender file and removed any lights or cameras 
    a) it appeared to maintain it's previous position and rotation .
4) export it as a .babylon   file 
5) now I should be able to import it as a model into the 3D tool.
