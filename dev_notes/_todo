TODO: 
1- move meta data files to dbdev.adder.io from localhost.
2- set up meta data index. 
#3- Get the 'sidebar' functionality for selecting meshes via button over image .
#4- Snap Shot FUnctionality and GridList
5- saving the design data, ie. as was done with 'userSession' in version 1 .
6- consider a "hasLoaded" method for models.



6- Figure out why Porsche Right door not getting image applied to it event though it has been added to the meta data and is editable.
   end of the trail is in 'AdderMeshWrapper:applyTextureFromDataURL()' 

(3) need a flag for showing billboard selection versus vehicle 
    background image 
    buttons that trigger mesh selection. 






 #done 
    renamed classes and class files to have a consistent prefix of adder.
    renamed mesh_ids in blender files and created new babylon files with the changed mesh names
    created the directory tree on the server for the ad_type,sub_type,detail,asset hierarchy.
    also renamed clickable meshes in same protocol. 
    changed meta data to match new files and naming conventions 
    changed meta files to house the 'pickable meshes' as a parameter array of mesh names. 
    created code to hide the sister meshes in the case of leftside_large, leftside_small,  where only one UVMapping structure is supposed to be visible.

fixed bugs:
# fixed: 9-10-2019 
   need to be able to change the image after a previous one has been applied. 
   billboard sign2 becomes invisible when picked ?  need somekind of flag for when to hide sister meshes....
# Server Issue: Cors: 
# The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains multiple values '*, *', but only one is allowed.


new bugs:
! can not get the Design Name to clear when deleting the previous design, HOWEVER, when a new one is saved after the delete it gets the new default name while the old name is still on display.


9-12-2019 compartmentalizing sections of the UI iconControlGroup and overlayControls   
   - create input for design name.
   - create functionality for deleteing a design , asking for confirmation, removing screenshots, clearing localStorage, disposing of meshes...

   When trying to clear the slate on the Main file , most is working but the 'textInput' component is keeping its own state element for design name....
   trying to find solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38901106/how-to-make-a-shared-state-between-two-react-components
Save and Delete are basically working.

how to do 'redo' and 'undo' 
   #1) - if a texture is 'applied to' a mesh then it needs to be 'un-applied'. 

   - if the camera is moved from position A to position B, then it might need to go back to position A.
   - if the Zoom Level changes, it might need to gpo back .


*** go through and make sure 'let' is used instaed of 'var'
