(3) need a flag for showing billboard selection versus vehicle 
    background image 
    buttons that trigger mesh selection. 
    





 #done 
    renamed classes and class files to have a consistent prefix of adder.
    renamed mesh_ids in blender files and created new babylon files with the changed mesh names
    created the directory tree on the server for the ad_type,sub_type,detail,asset hierarchy.
    also renamed clickable meshes in same protocol. 
    changed meta data to match new files and naming conventions 
    changed meta files to house the 'pickable meshes' as a parameter array of mesh names. 
    created code to hide the sister meshes in the case of leftside_large, leftside_small,  where only one UVMapping structure is supposed to be visible.

fixed bugs:
# fixed: 9-10-2019 
   need to be able to change the image after a previous one has been applied. 
   billboard sign2 becomes invisible when picked ?  need somekind of flag for when to hide sister meshes....
# Server Issue: Cors:
