TODO: 
move meta data files to dbdev.adder.io from localhost.

set up meta data index. 


 
 renamed classes and class files to have a consistent prefix of adder.
 renamed mesh_ids in blender files and created new babylon files with the changed mesh names
 created the directory tree on the server for the ad_type,sub_type,detail,asset hierarchy.
 also renamed clickable meshes in same protocol. 
changed meta data to match new files and naming conventions 
changed meta files to house the 'pickable meshes' as a parameter array of mesh names. 
created code to hide the sister meshes in the case of leftside_large, leftside_small,  where only one UVMapping structure is supposed to be visible.


next bugs:
need to be able to change the image after a previous one has been applied. 
billboard sign2 becomes invisible when picked ?  need somekind of flag for when to hide sister meshes....
