We will create a meta file for both
- 'ad types' and 
-'environment'

the ad types json will show relation ship of hiearchy with array of children at each new level and then at the end of the chain , the path to a meta data file for that model.

{
    "children": [
        {
            "ad_type":"Vehicle",
            "children":[]
        },
        {
            "ad_type":"Billboard",
            "children":[
               {
                   "sub_type":"One-Sided"
               } ,
               {
                   "sub_type":"Two-Sided",
                   "children":[
                       {
                           "detail":"Parallel",
                           "children":[]
                       },
                       {
                           "detail":"Angled",
                            "metafile":"path/to/angled/billboard.babylon"
                       }
                   ]
               }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
