we will include the image editor that Brandon has created on a separate branch of the version 1 adder creative tool.

 (1):
import 'tui-image-editor/dist/tui-image-editor.css'
 
import AdderImageEditor from "./dev/AdderImageEditor"

        <AdderImageEditor
            height={1400}
            width={1400}
            onApplyCallback={
                () => {
                    console.log("ON APPLY")
                }
            }
        />
